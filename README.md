# chifoumi_javaee
A "Chifoumi" game in Java EE 8

I tried to reach a comfortable level of abstraction about the gameplay by externalizing it in classes and Enum.
I wanted the Enums to reference the other Enums in the constructors, without having to use strings for that. 
But still didn't manage to find a good way for that (maybe a recursive constructor?).
